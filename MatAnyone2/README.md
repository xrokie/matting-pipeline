<strong>MatAnyone 2 is a practical human video matting framework that preserves fine details by avoiding segmentation-like boundaries, while also shows enhanced robustness under challenging real-world conditions.</strong>

## 🔎 Overview
![overall_structure](assets/matanyone1vs2.jpg)

## 🔧 Installation

### Conda
1. Clone Repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone2
    cd MatAnyone2
    ```

2. Create Conda Environment and Install Dependencies
    ```bash
    # create new conda env
    conda create -n matanyone2 python=3.10 -y
    conda activate matanyone2

    # install python dependencies
    pip install -e .
    # [optional] install python dependencies for gradio demo
    pip3 install -r hugging_face/requirements.txt
    ```

### uv
You may also install via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```bash
# create a new project and add matanyone2
uv init my-matting-project && cd my-matting-project
uv add matanyone2@git+https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone2.git
```

## 🔥 Inference

### Download Model
Download our pretrained model from [MatAnyone 2](https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone2/releases/download/v1.0.0/matanyone2.pth) to the `pretrained_models` folder (pretrained model can also be automatically downloaded during the first inference).

The directory structure will be arranged as:
```
pretrained_models
   |- matanyone2.pth
```

### Quick Test
We provide some examples in the [`inputs`](./inputs) folder. **For each run, we take a video and its first-frame segmenatation mask as input.** <u>The segmenation mask could be obtained from interactive segmentation models such as [SAM2 demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/SAM2-Image-Predictor)</u>. For example, the directory structure can be arranged as:
```
inputs
   |- video
      |- test-sample1          # folder containing all frames
      |- test-sample2.mp4      # .mp4, .mov, .avi
   |- mask
      |- test-sample1.png      # mask for targer person(s)
      |- test-sample2.png    
```
Run the following command to try it out:

```shell
# intput format: video folder
python inference_matanyone2.py -i inputs/video/test-sample1 -m inputs/mask/test-sample1.png

# intput format: mp4
python inference_matanyone2.py -i inputs/video/test-sample2.mp4 -m inputs/mask/test-sample2.png
```
- The results will be saved in the `results` folder, including the foreground output video and the alpha output video.
- If you want to save the results as per-frame images, you can set `--save-image`.
- If you want to set a limit for the maximum input resolution, you can set `--max-size`, and the video will be downsampled if min(w, h) exceeds. By default, we don't set the limit.

Or you may directly run via CLI command:
```shell
matanyone2 -i inputs/video/test-sample1 -m inputs/mask/test-sample1.png
```
- Run `matanyone2 --help` for a full list of options.

### Python API 🤗
You can load the model directly from Hugging Face using `from_pretrained` and run inference programmatically:

```python
from matanyone2 import MatAnyone2, InferenceCore

model = MatAnyone2.from_pretrained("PeiqingYang/MatAnyone2")
processor = InferenceCore(model, device="cuda:0")
processor.process_video(
    input_path="inputs/video/test-sample2.mp4",
    mask_path="inputs/mask/test-sample2.png",
    output_path="results",
)
``` 

## 🎪 Interactive Demo
To get rid of the preparation for first-frame segmentation mask, we prepare a gradio demo on [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/PeiqingYang/MatAnyone2) and could also **launch locally**. Just drop your video/image, assign the target masks with a few clicks, and get the the matting results!

*We integrate MatAnyone Series in the demo. [MatAnyone 2](https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone2) is the default model. You can also choose [MatAnyone](https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone) as your processing model in "Model Selection".*

```shell
cd hugging_face

# install GUI dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # FFmpeg required

# launch the demo
python app.py
```

By launching, an interactive interface will appear as follow.
